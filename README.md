# plane2Dshoot
When starting this project, it was aimed to be a basic introduction to using OpenGL and GLSL.
Not long later, the scope expanded to what it currently is due to a desire to use 2D maths for graphics.
The untidiness of code is very much down to this lack of planning in advance, and when returning to the project later it lead me to move onto mrredman instead where the scope is clearer.
